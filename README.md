<h1>Application of the Caesar Cipher</h1>
The program asks the user to write a message and the offset he wants and the application encrypts the written text. The message to be encrypted is stored in the "msg" variable and the encryption key (the offset to be applied to each letter) is stored in the "key" variable. The program uses a loop to go through each letter in the message, encrypting it and storing the encrypted letter back in the message. The final result is displayed on the screen using the syscall function with code 4 to print a string.
